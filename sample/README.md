# Sample Project showing how to use DTOGen

This is a simple project showing how straightfoward is to use DTOGen to generate DTOs from model classes.

It uses [Lombok](http://projectlombok.org) just to simplify creation of model classes, but it is not required for DTOGen.
[Hibernate Validator](https://hibernate.org/validator/) is not required either, but it is used to show how DTOGen is validation-aware.
